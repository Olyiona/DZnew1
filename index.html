<h3 class="main-content" >Early life and education</h3>
<p class="content" id="p1">Ray Charles Robinson [note 1] was the son of Bailey Robinson, a laborer, 
    and Aretha (or Reatha) Williams, a laundress, of Greenville, Florida.
    Aretha was described as a lovely slip of a girl with long wavy black 
    hair; she was also sickly and walked with a cane. Her mother had died 
    and her father, a man Bailey worked with, could not keep her. 
    The Robinson family—Bailey, his wife Mary Jane and his mother—informally
    adopted her and Aretha took the surname Robinson. A few years later 15 
    year old Aretha became pregnant by Bailey. During the ensuing scandal,
    she left Greenville late in the summer of 1930 to be with family in Albany, Georgia. 
    After the birth of Ray Charles, she and her baby returned to Greenville.
    Aretha and Bailey's wife, who had lost a son, then shared in Charles' 
    upbringing. His father abandoned the family, left Greenville, 
    and married another woman elsewhere. By his first birthday Charles
    had a brother, George. In later years, none could remember who was 
    George's father.[12] Charles cited Nat King Cole as a primary influence, 
    but his music was also influenced by Louis Jordan and Charles Brown.
    [12] He had a lifelong friendship and occasional partnership with Quincy 
    Jones. Frank Sinatra called Ray Charles "the only true genius in show 
    business," although Charles downplayed this notion.[13] Billy Joel said,
     "This may sound like sacrilege, but I think Ray Charles was more important 
     than Elvis Presley".[14]</p>
<h3 class="main-content">1952 1959: Atlantic Records</h3>    
<p class="content" id="p2">In June 1952, Atlantic bought Charles's contract for $2,500 
(US$24,070 in 2019 dollars[20]).[30][31] His first recording 
session for Atlantic ("The Midnight Hour"/"Roll with My Baby") 
took place in September 1952, although his last Swing Time release 
("Misery in My Heart"/"The Snow Is Falling") would not appear until 
February 1953.Charles started to lose his sight at the age of four[4] 
or five,[17] and was blind by the age of seven, apparently as a result 
of glaucoma.[18] Destitute, uneducated, and mourning the loss of her 
younger son, Aretha Robinson used her connections in the local community 
to find a school that would accept a blind African-American pupil. Despite
 his initial protest, Charles attended school at the Florida School for 
 the Deaf and the Blind in St. Augustine from 1937 to 1945.[12]

Charles further developed his musical talent at school[18] and was taught 
to play the classical piano music of J.S. Bach, Mozart and Beethoven. His 
teacher, Mrs. Lawrence, taught him how to use braille music, a difficult
 process that requires learning the left hand movements by reading braille
  with the right hand and learning the right hand movements by reading 
  braille with the left hand, and then combining the two parts.</p>
 <h3 class="main-content">1971 1983: Commercial decline</h3>
<p class="content" id="p3">Charles's renewed chart success, however, 
proved to be short lived,
and by the 1970s his music was rarely played on radio stations.
The rise of psychedelic rock and harder forms of rock and R&B 
music had reduced Charles' radio appeal, as did his choosing to 
record pop standards and covers of contemporary rock and soul hits,
since his earnings from owning his masters had taken away the 
motivation to write new material.In April 1979, his version of
"Georgia on My Mind" was proclaimed the state song of Georgia, 
and an emotional Charles performed the song on the floor of the
state legislature. In 1980 Charles performed in the musical film
The Blues Brothers.[18] Although he had notably supported the 
American Civil Rights Movement and Martin Luther King Jr. in 
the 1960s, Charles was criticized for performing at the Sun City
resort in South Africa in 1981, during an international boycott
protesting that country's apartheid policy. He later defended
his choice of performing there after insisting that the audience
of black and white fans would integrate while he was there.[18] </p>
